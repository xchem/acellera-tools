## Protein preparation tool 
Given a PDB file, ProteinPrepare uses `PropKa` for the protein
protonation and `PDB2PQR` for the hydrogen-bond network optimization. 

Using planemo (installation instructions available at https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#conda-experimental), a galaxy app can be created and tested with the following commands:

```planemo test --conda_ensure_channels iuc,bioconda,defaults,conda-forge,acellera proteinPrepare.xml```

```planemo serve --port 8080 --conda_ensure_channels iuc,bioconda,defaults,conda-forge,acellera proteinPrepare.xml```

You should then be able to navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and run ProteinPrepare as a Galaxy tool.

Running these commands with a conda environment activated can cause problems, even if it is the "base" environment. Planemo must be installed out of any conda environment.
